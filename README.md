# NetworkTrafficAnalysisProject
This responsitory is made by Deja Hintzen, Fabrittzio Cabrejos, and Brenda Nyiam to track all source code for our network traffic analysis tool. All code is for our Network Security class. Our tool allows users to upload packet capturing files to be analyzed and be given a summary about the anomalies found. It was built using the Python library scapy, which is a packet manipulation tool.


How to use:

1st. You need enter the file location of the packet capturing file that would would like to analyze then run the python file either from the console or the IDE of your choice.

2nd. The tool will read through eaach line of the packet capturing file and based on the parameters set for each anomaly, lines that are suspicious will be flagged.

3rd. You will be asked to save your results to a text file.
